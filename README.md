# Stock Price Analysis Project Using NumPy

## Overview

In this project, we analyze stock price data for trends and volatility using NumPy for numerical calculations. We will cover fetching stock data, calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, and visualizing the results.

---

## 1. Fetching Stock Price Data

First, you'll need historical stock price data. You can use APIs like [Yahoo Finance](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com/) or the `yfinance` library in Python to fetch stock prices.

### Example:
You can fetch data for a stock like Apple (AAPL) or Tesla (TSLA) over a specific period, such as the last year.

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing

Once you fetch the stock price data, you should clean it up. This includes:
- Removing missing values.
- Ensuring the data is sorted by date (ascending).
- Converting the data to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.

---

## 3. Trend Analysis

### Moving Averages
We can calculate both Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for different periods (e.g., 50 days, 200 days).

#### Formula for Simple Moving Average:
$$
\text{SMA} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n} \text{price}_i
$$

You can use NumPy's `convolve` function to calculate the moving averages:
```python
import numpy as np

def moving_average(data, window_size):
    return np.convolve(data, np.ones(window_size)/window_size, mode='valid')
```

### Price Trends
You can analyze the overall trend (upward, downward, or sideways) by comparing the current price to the moving averages.

---

## 4. Volatility Analysis

### Daily Returns
Calculate the daily returns (percentage change) of the stock to measure its volatility.

#### Formula for Daily Returns:
$$
\text{Return}_i = \frac{\text{price}_i - \text{price}_{i-1}}{\text{price}_{i-1}} \times 100
$$


You can use NumPy’s `diff` function to compute price changes between consecutive days:
```python
returns = np.diff(data) / data[:-1] * 100
```

### Standard Deviation (Volatility)
Use the standard deviation of daily returns to measure volatility. A higher standard deviation indicates more volatility.
```python
volatility = np.std(returns)
```

### Bollinger Bands
Create Bollinger Bands (upper and lower bands) to assess volatility. These bands are typically set 2 standard deviations away from the moving average.

---

## 5. Visualization

### Stock Price Chart
Plot the stock price over time along with moving averages.

### Volatility Chart
Plot daily returns and highlight periods of high volatility.

### Bollinger Bands Chart
Plot the stock price along with the upper and lower Bollinger Bands.

Use libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly` for visualization.

## 6. Example Code for Stock Price Analysis

Here's an example code to implement stock price analysis:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

# Fetch historical stock data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2023-01-01', end='2024-01-01')

# Get the closing prices
prices = data['Close'].to_numpy()

# Moving Average
window_size = 50
sma = np.convolve(prices, np.ones(window_size)/window_size, mode='valid')

# Daily Returns
returns = np.diff(prices) / prices[:-1] * 100

# Volatility (Standard Deviation)
volatility = np.std(returns)

# Bollinger Bands (2 standard deviations)
rolling_mean = np.convolve(prices, np.ones(window_size)/window_size, mode='valid')
rolling_std = np.std(prices[:window_size])

upper_band = rolling_mean + 2 * rolling_std
lower_band = rolling_mean - 2 * rolling_std

# Plotting the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

# Plot stock price with moving average
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(prices, label='Stock Price')
plt.plot(np.arange(window_size-1, len(prices)), sma, label=f'{window_size}-day Moving Average')
plt.title('Stock Price and Moving Average')
plt.legend()

# Plot volatility and Bollinger Bands
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(returns, label='Daily Returns', color='orange')
plt.axhline(y=volatility, color='r', linestyle='--', label=f'Volatility ({volatility:.2f}%)')
plt.fill_between(np.arange(window_size-1, len(prices)), lower_band, upper_band, alpha=0.2, label='Bollinger Bands')
plt.title('Daily Returns and Volatility')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## 7. Advanced Additions

You can expand this project by adding:
- **Price Prediction**: Use NumPy’s linear algebra functions to create a simple linear regression model for predicting future prices based on historical data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Compare the stock's performance with other indices or stocks to understand correlations.

---

This project will give you a solid foundation in stock price analysis while demonstrating the power of NumPy for handling large datasets and performing advanced numerical operations. Let me know if you need any help setting up or expanding on these features!
